Collection of cool media I remembered to record.

## Videos

- [Hank vs the Salamanca twins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZztVLP0oxM4)

  Gives me goosebumps every time I watch. Probably my favorite suspenseful action sequence.

  At this point in the show both Hank has been rattled by violent events in Mexico when he was transferred there, and the twins have been established as silent Terminator assasins.

  The character arcs add a huge amount of tension leading up to the fight, and the show beautifully illustrates Hank's headspace when he is warned by a phonecall prior to the assasins appearing.

  Definitely a must-watch.

  PS2 game I played as a kid. The mechs falling to earth from space is so cool.
