Initially I set out to create a 3D multiplayer RTS game using the Godot game engine.

I wanted to use a rollback networking system to ensure a smooth multiplayer experience.

When researching rollback implementations, I found that options for 3D Godot games are limited, because Godot's physics engine does not even try to achieve determinism.

Furthermore, options for integrating a deterministic 3D physics engine into Godot are also limited.

I decided to tackle this problem by integrating the [Rapier](https://rapier.rs/) physics engine into Godot.

The project is not quite ready to be used for games yet, but I plan to keep making steady progress over the long term so that I can create my RTS game.
