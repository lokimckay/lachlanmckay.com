I created Code Cabana Elements to speed up the development of my client projects.

I noticed that many clients were requesting similar functionality, so I decided to create a collection of elements that I could reuse across the projects, saving both my time and my clients' budgets.

They can be added to any website that allows you to enter custom code blocks.

I was planning to sell them, but decided to hold off until I can create a more plug-and-play product that doesn't require as much technical knowledge to install.

I plan to release a suite of Shopify sections soon that are more aligned with this vision.
