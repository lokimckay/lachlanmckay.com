Sometimes I create "widgets" for a game I play a lot - [Beyond All Reason](https://www.beyondallreason.info/).

They are small scripts written in [Lua](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language)>) that alter the functionality of the game in some way.

The game itself is largely made up of these widgets, which have been gradually improved over time by the community, which I think is pretty cool.
