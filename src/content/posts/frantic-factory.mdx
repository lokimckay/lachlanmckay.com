Frantic factory was a game idea I brainstormed with my university friend group.

A different idea was chosen to work on in the end.

## In a Nutshell

Frantic Factory is a 1v1 (Player vs AI) resource management game in which players send robotic units
through a maze of conveyor belts at the enemy base.
Player input involves selecting what type of building to have at the mouth of each of your conveyor belts
(economic, military, or turret) as well as some minor unit control functions.

## Units

All units will be spawned out of the military building type.
Most units can move against or with the conveyor belts movement. Some units are immobile.

### Example unit ideas

- Peewee - Tiny bot that can only shoot in front of itself short range
- Gator - Longer range tank slower fire rate
- Engineer - Repairs other units automatically + Builds stationary turrets on the side of conveyor belts
- Dude that can only shoot sideways
- Immobile dude - powerful but can't move by itself
- Reverser - Can reverse the direction of the conveyor belt it's standing on
