Alex fostered and then adopted Gordito from Goodwill Rescue, saving him from being put down. He's a 6 year old Bull Terrier and Husky mix with heterochromia. His name means "little fat one" in Spanish.

I wanted to purchase a bred Dobermann of my own instead of adopting my next dog, but Alex couldn't wait that long 😆
