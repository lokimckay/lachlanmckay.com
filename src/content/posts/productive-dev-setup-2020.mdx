title: üìÉ Productive Dev Setup 2020
date: 2020/09/05

In this post I walk through my personal developer setup and the tools I use to increase productivity.

You'll get the most value out of this post if you are a JavaScript developer working with Windows 10, but most info in this post translates to macOS and Linux, as well as other languages.

## üìÇ Directory Structure

Keep all developer related work under `C:/dev/` and then pin the subfolders to Quick Access.

```c
C:/dev/
  ‚îÇ
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ apps/         // installed programs go here
  ‚îÇ
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ installers/   // downloaded installer files, so you can uninstall later
  ‚îÇ
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ repos/        // git repositories
  ‚îÇ
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ shortcuts/    // shortcuts to deep paths that you frequently visit
                    // E.g. C:\WINDOWS\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
```

## üîó Quick Access

Make the windows file explorer Quick Access more useful by removing the cruft

1. Create the above directory structure
1. On Windows 10 go to `File` -> `Change folder and search options` in an explorer window
1. Under `Privacy`, untick `Show recently used files in Quick Access`
1. Unpin any unwanted items from Quick Access
1. Pin the above folders from `C:/dev/` to Quick Access by right clicking them

## üíæ Git

https://git-scm.com/downloads

Industry standard source code management. Never lose your work, and never make an un-correctable mistake in your source code.

Download it to `C:/dev/installers`, and install it to `C:/dev/apps`

## ‚úàÔ∏è Terminal

<div
  style={{
    height: 200,
    marginTop: 16,
    backgroundImage: "url(https://cmder.net/img/main.png)",
    backgroundPosition: "50% 40%",
    backgroundColor: "#F0F5F9",
    backgroundSize: "cover",
  }}
/>

Navigating a GUI is slow, and when working with remote deployments in many cases, a GUI is not available.

Every developer should be familiar with the basics of using a terminal.

Don‚Äôt use the subpar terminal that comes bundled with Git. For a clean and satisfying experience, I recommend installing [Cmder Mini](https://cmder.net/) and then integrating Cmder with [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) or [Hyper](https://hyper.is/) depending on your OS.

- [Windows Terminal (Win 10)](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal)
- [Hyper (any OS)](https://hyper.is/)

## üíª Editor

You want your code editor to start quickly and be as responsive as possible, but still provide essential features like syntax highlighting.

I recommend these 2 editors:

- [Atom](https://atom.io/) (by Github)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (by Microsoft)

Currently I use VS Code and recommend installing these extensions:

- [Git Lens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens)
- [Path Autocomplete](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ionutvmi.path-autocomplete)
- [Formatting Toggle](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tombonnike.vscode-status-bar-format-toggle)

## üê¢ Node version manager (NVM)

[Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) | [macOS/Linux](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

When working with Node, you might occasionally want to change versions in order to debug issues or get certain features.
It's a pain to uninstall and reinstall node each time you want to do this.

NVM allows you to easily switch node versions by entering `nvm use <desired version>` in your terminal

## üëÅÔ∏è Instant Eyedropper

http://instant-eyedropper.com/

Allows you to get the hex code of any colour on your screen using `Alt` + <code>` (backtick)</code>

## ü•Ω PowerToys

https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys

> Microsoft PowerToys is a set of utilities for power users to tune and streamline their Windows experience for greater productivity.

Sometimes I find that using `Win` + `Arrow Key` to position my windows is not sufficient.

The _Fancy Zones_ utility allows you to snap windows in a variety of configurations with a nice gutter simply by holding `Shift` while dragging a window

## üìñ Notion

https://www.notion.so/

I've tried many productivity apps, and [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) covers many of their use cases.

It's easy to create documentation, ToDo lists, journal entries etc. and it's free for personal use.
