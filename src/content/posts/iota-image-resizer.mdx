## Rationale

I needed to create Iota to automate the process of generating tiny images in order to use the [progressive image loading](https://jmperezperez.com/medium-image-progressive-loading-placeholder/) technique.

Iota allows you to create a copy of a directory tree with every image in
that tree resized to a desired percentage value.

This is useful in the scenario I just mentioned when you want to switch
between referring to a full size image vs a tiny version of that same
image.

Example:

```cs
https://myimagehost.com/username/images/full/cats/cat1.jpg  //Full size image
https://myimagehost.com/username/images/tiny/cats/cat1.jpg  //Tiny image
```
