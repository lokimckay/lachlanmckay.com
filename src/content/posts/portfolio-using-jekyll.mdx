## Summary

Upgraded my personal website to leverage more modern tech such as bootstrap,
jekyll and masonry. Improved a lot of issues such as image load times and
responsiveness.

## Rationale

I decided to refactor lachlanmckay.com at the beginning of 2018 as a way
to learn some more modern technologies in front-end web dev such as
Bootstrap and Jekyll. I heard about Jekyll being the engine behind
Github pages, and being a strong advocate of Git over other VC
solutions, I wanted to check it out. From my initial research it looked
like a great alternative to Hugo, (which is what I was using for version
1 of this site) so I dove in.

## Objectives

My goal for the second phase was to address the following issues with
the site as it was in version 1:

1. All images much too big for the area they actually occupy, which
   costs far too much page load time
1. Hugo does not allow me to use variables everywhere I want to; it is
   difficult to keep the source organized
1. Responsiveness for mobile is okay, but not ideal for maximum
   readability - I am simply scaling elements up/down in some areas

## Solutions

I resolved these issues as described:

1. Solved using the [srcSet](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_source_srcset.asp) css attribute to load different images based on the width of the browser
   window
1. Thankfully Jekyll has far greater flexibility over Hugo regarding where
   you can define and use variables, which is a big win for source
   organization
1. Bootstrap has amazing responsiveness out of the box through it's 12 column
   grid system. I can see why this tech is so widely used

## Tricks

#### Centering issue - scrollbar shift

When a vertical scrollbar is present, centering (using automatic margins)
becomes slightly shifted to the left - off center. I leveraged a
combination of two solutions, one from [Ayke van LaÃ«them](https://aykevl.nl/2014/09/fix-jumping-scrollbar) and another from [Chyno Deluxe](https://teamtreehouse.com/community/how-to-prevent-scrollbar-from-shifting-content-of-the-page)
to produce this solution:

```css
html,
body {
  margin-right: calc((100vw - 100%) * -1);
}
```

Here's how it works:

```css
html, body {
  margin-right: calc((100vw - 100%) * -1);
}

calc(100vw - 100%)
/*  Width of entire viewport including scrollbar
    subtract
    Width of entire viewport excluding scrollbar */

* -1);
/*  multiplied by -1
    = negative width of scrollbar */

margin-right:
/*  Increase the right margin by this amount.
    The page will shift to the right by the exact amount taken up by the scrollbar,
    which will be 0 if it is not present. */
```

The tables below give a complete list of all the technologies involved in the
second phase of this site, and how I put them to use.

## Retrospective

#### What went well?

- Jekyll very flexible and easy to learn, great source organization
- Very fast development thanks to leveraging many open-source tools & plugins listed above
- Homepage is still impressive, but unlike v1, is now great with SEO, has much better load time and unlikely to be skipped
- Image load times have improved
- Site load times faster in general due to using cdn's for plugins and minifying site html
- Navigation is clear, does not require hovering
- About me page is less cluttered, but has more information
- Site is cleaner and more readable in general

#### What could be improved?

- Jekyll build watch must be restarted every time `\_config.yml` is updated

#### What still puzzles me?

- Is there a way to reload `\_config.yml` automatically?
