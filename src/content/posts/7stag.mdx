7Stag was my first attempt at an ecommerce business. My idea was to pay some great artists that I liked to create T-shirt designs that they allowed me to sell on my store.

Instead of using a bland Shopify store, I wanted to create a custom front-end using NextJS, which I was learning at the time.

In hindsight I should have started with a generic Shopify store to prove that the product would sell, before investing a lot of time into the development of the custom front-end.

In the end I didn't make any sales and abandoned the project, but it was still a valuable learning experience.

Below are the low-res versions of the designs that I commissioned

Shoot me an email if you'd like the full-res versions
