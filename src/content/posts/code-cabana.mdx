I started Code Cabana so that I could work for myself, servicing clients directly.

During the Covid pandemic, it was becoming increasingly popular to become self-employed.

I felt that it was time for me to take a risk and venture out on my own as well.

My full-time job at Liquid Interactive was very kind to allow me to work part-time while I built up my clientbase.

So far things have been going well, consistent work is flowing in with relatively little marketing efforts.
