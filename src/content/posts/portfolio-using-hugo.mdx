## Summary

Version 1 of `lachlanmckay.com` was a great success in that I was
able to get my feet wet with hosting, deployment and some source
management using Hugo. However it still had many problems related to
load times, SEO and navigtation. I aimed to fix these issues in the
second version, which you can <a href="/posts/portfolio-using-jekyll">read about here</a>

show to potential employers. I wanted it to include a portfolio of
impressive visual content as the main attraction.

## Objectives

- Visually impressive

The tables below give a complete list of all the technologies involved
in the first phase of this site, and how I used them.

## Retrospective

#### What went well?

- Splash page - Full page youtube video background with audio playing is very cool
- Gallery shows a lot of my work in a single page
- Animated gifs give the user lots of interesting things to look at

#### What could be improved?

- All images (particularly gallery images) are too big for the space they occupy. It takes way too long to load gallery pages
- It takes way too long to load youtube background video, people would have clicked on something already
- Navigation images are cool, but the user does not immediately know where they will be going like they would with text
- Splash page does not help SEO efforts
- Source code is somewhat messy - things that should be in the theme are in site content directories
- Audio on a homepage can be annoying, maybe it should be removed

#### What still puzzles me?

- How to layout gallery images in a nice format similar to pInterest
- Should I completely eliminate the splash page?
