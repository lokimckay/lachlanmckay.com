Resurface is a Chrome browser extension that allows you to replace Code Mirror editors (which are commonly found in ancient website builders like Squarespace) with a much better one (Monaco)

I created this tool because I was frustrated with using Squarespace's code editor, which doesn't even have a working search function.

I added a watermark and subscription model to the extension, but it didn't generate much revenue.
