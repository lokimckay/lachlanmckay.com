import Github from "@/components/embeds/github-repo.astro";

<Github id="lokimckay/skeletons" />

Replaced my `preact-skeletons` project with a more general one. Added components for Astro as well as Preact.

I often find myself creating the same wrappers around HTML elements when creating projects.

So I created this repository to save some time in future.
