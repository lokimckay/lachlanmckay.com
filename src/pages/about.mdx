# {favicon} About Loki

## Bio

- I'm an analytical person who loves to create art using technology
- I live with my beautiful girlfriend and our 2 dogs
- My dog _Bazooka_ is a Dobermann
- My girlfriend's dog _Gordito_ is a Bull Terrier + Husky mix

## Focus

At the moment, my focus is on building a portfolio of digital revenue streams so that I can have more time to pursue my less profitable passions.

## Philosophy

- I prefer to listen than speak
- You only get one life
- _"A dead man gathers no goods"_
- Discard everything that doesn't serve you
- Starting from scratch with improved knowledge is fun

I'm a believer and have experienced firsthand the benefits of maintaining a positive mindset even in the face of overwhelming odds.

I think being able to selectively discard logical thinking whenever it would lead to despair or negativity is a valuable mental skill.

However I also understand that sometimes there are impossible circumstances. It's unreasonable to generally advise everyone to be perpetually optimistic, even if it would benefit them in your opinion.
