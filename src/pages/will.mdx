# Last Will and Testament ðŸŒ 

If you're reading this, I have probably passed away.

To my family and friends, I love you and am so grateful to have had you in my life.  
I hope to ease part of your suffering through outlining my wishes here.

## Organs

If feasible, donate my organs in this order of preference:

1. family or friends
2. others in need
3. scientific / medicinal research

I understand that organ donation may only be possible if I have gotten around to registering for it, which might not be the case.

## Interment

Locations of significance for me:

| Location                 | Significance                                                           |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Kurrawa beach QLD        | Surf life saving every sunday with my dad and brother when I was young |
| Manly beach NSW          | Childhood beach                                                        |
| Bondi beach NSW          | Childhood beach                                                        |
| Southbank beach / lagoon | I went swimming here for a first date with my SO                       |

I have no preference between cremation or burial, nor coffin, nor closed/open casket etc. I leave these decisions up to my family members.

Here are some ideas I liked the sound of; choose whatever makes logistical and financial sense.

- Scatter my ashes at a beach
- Bury me on a coastal hill overlooking a beach
- Plant a tree in soil mixed with my ashes on a coastal hill overlooking a beach

- [Mix my ashes into an artistic glassware piece](https://www.google.com/search?q=cremated+ashes+glassware&tbm=isch)

## Ceremonial music

Please play [Debussy's _Claire de Lune_](https://youtu.be/ea2WoUtbzuw) as background music at the funeral.  
I listen to it frequently while working and find it beautifully relaxing.

## Assets

I leave all that I have first to my S.O., then to my family members, and then to the following charities that are meaningful to me:

- https://fund.blender.org
- https://sls.com.au/donate-now
- https://fundraising.awlqld.com.au

See you in the next life!
