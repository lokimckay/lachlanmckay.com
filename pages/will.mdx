If you're reading this, I have probably passed away.

To my family and friends, I love you and am so grateful to have had you in my life.  
I hope to ease part of your suffering through outlining my wishes here:

### Organs

If feasible, donate my organs in this order of preference:

1. family or friends
2. others in need
3. scientific / medicinal research

I understand organ donation may only be possible if I have registered for it, which might not be the case.

### Interment

Locations of significance for me:

| Location                          | Significance                                          |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Kurrawa beach QLD                 | Surf life saving every sunday with my dad and brother |
| Manly beach NSW                   | Childhood beach                                       |
| Bondi beach NSW                   | Childhood beach                                       |
| Southbank Brisbane beach / lagoon | I went swimming here with Alex for our first date     |

I have no preference between cremation or burial. I leave this decision up to my closest family members.  
Here are some cool ideas I liked the sound of; choose whatever makes logistical and financial sense

- Scatter my ashes at a beach
- Plant a tree in soil mixed with my ashes on a coastal hill overlooking a beach
- [Grow a portable plant in soil mixed with my ashes](https://urnabios.com/)
- [Mix my ashes into an artistic glassware piece](https://www.google.com/search?q=cremated+ashes+glassware&tbm=isch)

### Coffin

I have no preference for coffin appearance, open casket vs closed casket or flower arrangements etc.  
Choose whatever makes logistical and financial sense

### Ceremonial music

Play [Debussy's _Claire de Lune_](https://youtu.be/ea2WoUtbzuw) as background music at some point during my funeral  
Avoid giant organ pipes please, yuck

### Addendum

If I have legally binding docs to back this information up, they will be in my black expanding file organizer.  
These documents probably also contain important information that I can't list here including:

- Beneficiaries
- Executors
- Instructions for access to my digital assets
