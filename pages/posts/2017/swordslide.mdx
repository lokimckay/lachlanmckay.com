## Premise

In Swordslide, you play as Akio, a fallen samurai who is pursuing his deceased
lover through descending levels of the afterlife.

The objective is to eliminate enemies in a given level as quickly as possible.
Levels are unlocked in an "angry birds" style star system - completing bonus
challenges in a level unlocks more soul points, which are required to unlock
subsequent levels.

## Reflection

Our goal for swordslide was to create a wide range of varied enemy behaviours
and types, that were visually distinct. The player should be able to guess
what an enemy will do immediately upon first sight based on it's appearance.

After a lengthy 6-month development period, the team's excitement around the
idea began to fade. Being fresh out of university, we began to pick up other
commitments. Currently, this project has been left in a state of limbo.

I would really like to begin a new project with these guys at a more
convenient time in the future, as we are great friends and share a great
passion for awesome games.
