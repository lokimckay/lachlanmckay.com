I passed the [MuleSoft Certified Developer - Level 1 (Mule 4)](https://training.mulesoft.com/certification/developer-mule4-level1) proctored exam and am now a certified Mulesoft developer.

From the course page:

> The MCD ‚Äì Level 1 (Mule 4) exam validates that a developer has the required knowledge and skills to design, build, test and debug, deploy, and manage basic APIs and integrations: moving from Anypoint Platform to Anypoint Studio and back. Certified candidates should be able to:
>
> - Use MuleSoft-hosted Anypoint Platform to take a basic API through all the steps of its lifecycle: design, build, deploy, manage, and govern.
> - Use Anypoint Studio to build, test, and debug basic integrations and API implementations.
> - Connect to a range of resources including databases, files, web services, SaaS applications, and JMS queues.
> - Perform basic data transformations using DataWeave 2.0.
> - Control event flow and handle errors.
> - Process batch records.

The exam required me to complete 50+ hours of online self-paced training, which was a combination of theory, walkthroughs and DIY exercises.

On the day of the exam, I needed to complete 60 multiple choice questions while being monitored by an online proctor who prevents cheating

My advice for anyone taking this course: make sure you understand the following specific sections of the training material, as there will be multiple questions about the same concept:

- What values are accessible / available when moving between flow references / internal HTTP requests / forEach loops / batch jobs.
- Execution path once an error occurs within a flow. What is returned as a response if the error is handled within an `OnErrorContinue` vs `OnErrorPropagate` scope? etc.
- Syntax for accessing different parts of the mule event in dataweave expressions
- Syntax for using configuration properties and how they can be used in global elements
- Outputs of various things. E.g. What does a Scatter-Gather module return? What does the dataweave map function return? etc.

Once you pass the course (at least 70% of answers correct) you are able to [print your digital certificate](<(https://help.learn.mulesoft.com/hc/en-us/articles/360049522774-How-can-I-download-my-Certification-exam-certificate)>)
