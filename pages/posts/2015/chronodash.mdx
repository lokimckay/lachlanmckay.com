## Premise

ChronoDash is a couch multiplayer (up to 4 people) asymmetrical
foot-racing game. The goal is to collect as many coins as possible while
racing and battling the other players. Each character has a unique
ultimate ability to help you get ahead in the race.

This group project was my final 3rd year university assignment at
Griffith University.
